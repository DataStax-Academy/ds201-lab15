# DS201 Exercise 15

## Write Path

**In this hands-on lab, you will:**
*	Watch the commit log as data is written to the database
*	Use *nodetool* to view statistics for a CQL table
*	Force data that has been written in memory to flush to disk
*	Look for commit log segments being replayed when starting a node


Cassandra has an optimized write path. It can be very helpful to understand the write path to make use of Cassandra effectively.
